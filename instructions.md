# Quality Hug Instructions

### Mindset

Good hugs are born out of inherent love and goodwill for your fellow human being. Without this, you can't give good hugs! You may already have this for friends and loved ones, you just need to spread that goodwill into your perception of humans in general. Cultivate this before proceeding further. If you find through introspection that you think humans are generally pretty swell and/or dandy, you're ready to proceed.

### Fundamentals

The foundation of a good hug is to hug the entire person rather than just a part of them. You may already be aware that there are those who hug just to pull a certain part of themselves or others together, through personal experience or otherwise. It's difficult to express the mechanical difference between hugging the entire person and hugging just to get boobage, but the intent is always clear to both parties while the hug is in progress.

### Hug Strength

Tight or strong hugs are not universally enjoyable, whereas soft hugs are. The feeling behind a nice big bear hug is never mistaken, and that aspect is always appreciated, but it may be physically uncomfortable for the recepient! Always go with soft hugs when in doubt.

### Degree of Softness

You may have had or potentially still have a favorite plush, and you can probably think of how you hug this particular softie. Your hugs should be similar to the hugs you give to plushies. A hug is a two-way transaction; imagine yourself as the plushie as well, and carry that mindset into the hug. This will result in a hug with a quality level of softness!

### Plushie Sidekick

Speaking of plushies, it doesn't hurt to carry a soft inanimate buddy with you to receive hugs in your stead. Willingness, as will be covered later in this document, is a critical facet of quality hugs, and for some people it may be inherently uncomfortable to hug someone they don't know. A plushie belonging to someone they don't know is a much safer proposition. Someone may request hugging the plushie instead of you. Please do not take offense to this; they still want to receive the love you are offering, just through a proxy. This approach is completely valid! Also, it's adorable, and adorable is great.

### Nuzzles?

Snuggly, nuzzly hugs are very nice, but are not suitable for the general population. You should save nuzzles for your most dearest of loved ones, as a trump card to show them that they are the most special to you! Even in relationships with a lot of love though, nuzzles can be uncomfortable on a person-by-person basis, so use your good judgment or simply communicate to determine whether or not to deploy this ultra soft maneuver.

### Distribution Process

You should only give hugs to those who are willing to receive them. Do not foist your hugs onto unwilling recipients; this completely fouls the hug! Both parties must be willing, else the hug will be bad for everyone.

By carrying the sign included in this repository, you are indicating your own willingness very clearly. Willingness from others will often be very clearly indicated by approaching with open arms, or through explicit verbal request.

When you yourself would like to hug a fellow human being who is not clearly indicating willingness to receive, verbal request is always the safest bet, though it is acceptable to open your arms **without approaching.** When your request is denied, always respond with dignity, understanding, and a smile. After all, it's completely valid to not wish to be hugged, for any reason at all.

### Hygeine

Okay, I will break down into hyperbole to express this critical point as clearly as possible.

If you smell like a dirty old sock peed on bukkake-style by a cadre of homeless fartmeisters, nobody's going to want to hug you, and you don't deserve any damn hugs anyways for smelling like an ogre's taint! Clean your stank-ass self up, fam!

Seriously, be clean and smell nice! This should go without saying, but I am saying it anyways to be safe because I don't want this repo to be responsible for some stanky ass-tier hugs. Shower well and apply deodorant and/or body spray in a **tasteful** dose. **Deodorant and body spray are not substitutes for a shower!**

If you find yourself wet or sweaty, you may stink despite your best efforts otherwise. It may be better to stop offering hugs in this situation. If you have a plushie sidekick that is safe from your naturally-imposed stank, let it take over for you.

### Conclusion

Congratulations, your hugs are now bomb AF. Enjoy spreading love through the world! <3
