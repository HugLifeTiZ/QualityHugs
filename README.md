# Quality Hugs
## The softest of all software!
### Version 1.0

This repo contains instructions on how to give good hugs to your fellow human beings. It also includes a sign to advertise the fact that you give these hugs and they are freely available at request. The sign is available in ODT as well as a PDF export for convenience.

If you find any issues with the instruction or implementation of the procedure, please file an issue in the issue tracker. To make your own modifications, fork this repository. You can also contribute back by creating a pull request, and hugs for everyone will become better by so doing! Please feel free to translate the directions and sign to other languages!

The original author of this software chose the \#HugLife, and the \#HugLife chose him. Let's all work together to spread love through the world!
